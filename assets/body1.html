Everything has a season and a reason. That is how I introduce this article. We all love good "up time" when it happens, and we live for it when it works for us. What about that "down time" where we have to train and work for the next "up time"? That is what this article is primarily about. I like and love a party and good times like anyone, but I know that there is always a price to be paid for those times in-between those times. That is the training ground to prepare for all the benefits and to be able to use them well when they come.

So, the rhymes and reasons of life are the rhythms, cause and effect realities and conditions we work with, not an inconvenience. Nothing is free, everything has a fee whether in effort or whatever currency tangible or intangible is the payment method to ultimately benefit. Even a farmer has to pay time and effort to grow their crops right or milk their cows with good grass or hay grown. Reality is a cycle of payment and benefit really. Nothing more, nothing less.

Sure, I can be a little less realistic and say something like: "there are some effort free things in life". I cannot honestly do thar. Even the free things take effort to recognize and understand, so even those "free" things are not totally "free" or clear, right down to achieving genuine enlightenment. Those things take supreme, sublime and powerful effort beyond the normal things. Why do you think that is called metaphysical instead of just regular physical? "Meta" means beyond or finer, regular is below meta or beyond, it is normal. Indeed, we can earn a living, but to get beyond that to genuine enlightenment is the real goal after you genuinely establish yourself in that sense. But, for the sake of comfort, how many can get up and admit that reality? I can. For the rest of you though, you have to answer that question yourself by searching your being.

The "uncomfortable" reality that free will and fully being your genuine self entails and the "comfortable" reality of routine life and being what people expect you to be and conforming are hard choices, I know. Indeed though, the best of us face them and earn our way up. The worst of us go down without a fight or "escape through destructive cheating". So, in the final synopsis, to genuinely achieve without faking it, we must pay the full price and ultimately benefit through that honesty that knows genuine courage to persevere. The genuine down time is when we do something just to be something we invest in without love, understanding or internal satisfaction. After all if we love both the process and the goal achieved, it is all up time. To quote Aristotle: "Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence." Reasonably and realistically that is reality if we love our goal and achievement processes.
