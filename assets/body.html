Life is reincarnation consistently. What I mean is: It is like a refurbished used car at this point that is bought fixed up and made new even though it may have many miles on it. I mean, we have had many chances through much time of living, use and evolution to get it right ultimately. Indeed, existence itself is its own back-up plan and everything else means nothing, especially human laws and decrees on what works and what does not work. There is something to that saying that "there is always tomorrow", and the saying about "eternal now being cold hard cash unlike yesterday and tomorrow". Because, reality comes down to not what we want or decree, it comes down to what is to bring it down to the most simplistic and realistic terms possible.

When I think of back-up plans, I usually have unrealistic Rube Goldberg (or Reuben Garrett Lucius Goldberg) and Wiley E. Coyote of Road Runner Saturday morning cartoon fame cartoon images of them for this reason: If existence never stops existing and we always get a chance through consistent reincarnation of energies, why worry and why wait for the "Gold Star" of getting it right in the "fewest tries"? Well, the sooner and better you get it, the better you can grow. Indeed, growth and power over our circumstances are the real "Gold Stars" we are waiting for. Not to be acknowledged by others or "made official", and the real back-up plan in all reality is genuine growth and understanding, all else does not count really except as "stamp collecting" and "seat filler" that poses as "The Gold Star" that says "Great, you won" that people can give you.

Anyone can get all the accolades, awards, and titles in the world and existence, but if you do not have the back-up plan of genuine growth and understanding, all that means nothing. What do you think Jesus Christ really meant by telling the leaders, Priests and Scribes of his time without the consciousness of God to back them up that their titles without the backing of genuine God will lead to Hell or oblivion anyhow? Without the real consciousness of knowledge, knowledge and titles mean nothing. With that pure genuine consciousness, you have everything, and the titles could be earned anywhere really when you really have it to back it all up.

As long as there is existence and energy in reality, there is always a choice and a chance in reality.
