			<p>		An online payday loan allows consumers to borrow up to $1000, 
			depending on their state’s regulations and the consumer’s monthly 
			income. Payday loans are designed to be short-term loans, helping 
			complete a financial crisis until the next payday. Online payday 
			loan companies add convenience to the process.<br>
			<br>
			PAYDAY LOAN Process<br>
			<br>
			Once you&#39;ve found an online payday loan company, you&#39;ll need to fill 
			out an application that includes your contact information and 
			monthly income. You will also need to work through a repayment plan. 
			If you use a traditional payday loan store, you will need to create 
			a postdated check that the lender supports. Payday loan companies 
			will deduct the payment from your bank checking account 
			automatically.<br>
			<br>
			When your application has been submitted and approved, you will 
			receive your money advance. A traditional lender will issue you a 
			check, while online companies line the cash to your bank checking 
			account. Your repayment will be anticipated in the next short term, 
			or you can prolong the loan for longer by paying additional fees.<br>
			<br>
			Payday Fees<br>
			<br>
			Payday loan lenders demand fees exactly like any financing company. 
			Fees include a process cost and interest. To create comparability 
			shopping easy, the federal government requires lenders to create an 
			APR, which includes both fees and interest. This is actually the 
			rate you&#39;ll pay if you kept the loan out for a whole year.<br>
			<br>
			If you compare the APR of an online payday loan to a home loan, you 
			will notice an enormous difference. However, payday loans are only 
			intended to be taken for a couple of days, which means that your 
			actual fees will be lower. The APR is still a good way to compare 
			payday companies to find the best package.<br>
			<br>
			Online Payday Loan Lenders<br>
			<br>
			Payday loan lenders follow yet guidelines as traditional lenders, 
			however, they enable you to apply anytime for an advance loan. They 
			also copy your cash electronically, which means you don’t have to 
			hassle with assessments and vacations to the bank.<br>
			<br>
			Some online lenders also offer better discounts, especially for 
			first-time borrowers. They could waive fees or offer reduced rates. 
			It pays to look at several different websites to find the most 
			affordable fees for your money advance.</p>
