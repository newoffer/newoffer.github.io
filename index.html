<p>Apply For A Loan<br>
<br>
Once in a while, we have taken away a bank loan for just one reason or another. 
It seems to be a part of modern life, as everyone I know has got a loan. We just 
get one loan paid off, have a limited period of sense smug and then find that 
people need to use for financing again. This may be to consolidate bad debts, 
purchase home advancements or buy an automobile. We also got one out to place 
our daughter through university or college.<br>
<br>
It isn't the actual loan that bothers me, I've accepted it as a means of life, 
it is the process you have to undergo to get one. Perhaps our parent's 
technology got the right idea. They wouldn't want to obtain a loan. If they 
couldn't find the money for something, they simply kept up until that they had 
enough money. My technology does not have the patience to wait. So, we must leap 
through the hoops whenever we want one.<br>
<br>
I always feel just like a gathering with the bank manager is similar to going to 
the top Teacher's office. Personally, I think guilty but I don't know what I 
sense guilty about. The director is always correctly friendly and helpful but I 
still feel just like I'm in the dentist's ready room. Maybe, it is because of 
some Protestant work ethic instilled in me by my parents. WHENEVER I obtain a 
loan, I'm requesting money I haven't earned. Obviously, I know this is the 
one-way banks make their revenue and the complete banking system would collapse 
if it were not for folks like me.<br>
<br>
I hate filling in forms and the same forms come around, again and again, asking 
the same questions. Every time we obtain a loan, we have to prove id, even 
though we have been going to the same branch of our standard bank for years. 
They need to execute a credit check on us. Ironically, we've friends who have 
been refused to finance because they have no credit rating. They may have good 
jobs and may easily spend the money for repayments, but asking for a loan for 
the very first time means that you have no credit score to be assessed. We've 
plenty of history! The worst thing, whenever we apply for a loan, is those ten 
minutes approximately whenever we are remaining alone at work whilst the 
administrator pops out to do all the checks. We've never been refused but almost 
always there is a first time. It's wintry perspire time as he comes home into 
the room. It's ok! He's smiling and we don't have to do that again, until the 
next time.</p>
