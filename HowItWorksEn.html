            <h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>Requesting a loan is easy with www.fastloan.site. Fill out one easy form on www.fastloan.site and your inquiry will be
  submitted to our large network of lenders. Loan amounts range from $100 to $5,000 (exact amounts vary based on lender programs
  and your state of residence). You can have a response from one of our lenders the same day, and often within minutes. Once
  your loan is approved, you will be redirected to the lender's website where you can review the terms of the loan, including
  details about all the applicable rates and fees. If you accept these terms, the lender will deposit money directly into
  your bank account as quickly as the next day.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Most lenders have the following requirements to be approved:</strong>
</p>
<p>To be accepted by most lenders in our network, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be employed at your present job for at least 90 days.</li>
  <li>Be a US citizen or a permanent resident, and over the age of 18.</li>
  <li>Have an income of around $1,000 per month after tax deductions.</li>
  <li>Have a checking account in your name.</li>
  <li>Provide a working telephone number for your home and work.</li>
  <li>Provide a valid email address.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick Inquiry Process</h2>
<p>Through our secure technology, we will find a lender in our network that is willing to take work with you based on the information
  you submit. Once we have a lender ready to work with you, that lender will contact you to get any additional information
  they might need (such as verification of employment, pay stubs, etc.).</p>
<h2>Cash Sent Directly to You</h2>
<p>After your lender has taken and approved your request, cash will be deposited directly into your bank account. That means
  you don’t have to take a trip to the bank to endorse and deposit a check or pay check-cashing fees.</p>
<h2>Private and Secure</h2>
<p>We use industry-recognized security and advanced encryption technology to protect your personal information.</p>
<h2>Automated Repayment</h2>
<p>If you authorize your lender to take payment via automatic withdrawals (known as "ACH transfers"), then your loan payments
  will be paid automatically directly from your bank account. This means each payment will be on time and you won’t have
  to worry about missing any payments or incurring any late fees.</p>
<h2>Late Payments</h2>
<p>Late payment policies can differ among lenders. Please make sure you read and understand the loan agreement and your lender’s
  late payment policy before accepting the loan. In some states, late fees may be limited by law. In other states, late payments
  may allow the lender to charge late fees and may accelerate the loan making it due in full immediately.</p>
<p>NOTE: Before agreeing to a loan, please make sure you can make your loan payments in full and on time. We support the responsible
  use of loans and recognize that nobody knows your situation better than you.</p>
<h2>Loan Extensions</h2>
<p>State law may limit or prohibit a lender’s ability to extend or "roll over" your loan. Consult with your lender if you need
  a loan extension.</p>
<h2>Loan Default</h2>
<p>If you can’t make your loan payments on time, you may be in default of your loan obligations. Late payments and loan defaults
  may adversely affect your credit and may make it difficult to obtain future loans.</p>

  <strong>Important Disclosures. Please Read Carefully.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of shorter duration loans is to provide the borrower temporary financial relief. Such loans are not a long-term
  financial solution. Persons facing serious financial difficulties should consider other alternatives or should seek out
  professional financial advice.
</p>
<p>
  This website is not an offer to lend. www.fastloan.site is not a lender and does not make loan or credit decisions. www.fastloan.site
  connects interested persons with a lender from its network of approved lenders. www.fastloan.site does not control and is
  not responsible for the actions or inactions of any lender, is not an agent, representative or broker of any lender, and
  does not endorse any lender. www.fastloan.site receives compensation from its lenders, often based on a ping-tree model similar
  to Google AdWords where the highest available bidder is connected to the consumer. Regardless, www.fastloan.site’s service
  is always free to you.
</p>
<p>
  This service is not available in all states. If you request a loan in a particular state where such loans are prohibited,
  or in a location where www.fastloan.site does not have an available lender, you will not be connected to a lender. In some
  cases, you may be given the option of obtaining a loan from a tribal lender. Tribal lenders are subject to tribal and certain
  federal laws while being immune from state law including usury caps. If you are connected to a tribal lender, please understand
  that the tribal lender’s rates and fees may be higher than state-licensed lenders. Additionally, tribal lenders may require
  you to agree to resolve any disputes in a tribal jurisdiction. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan
  offered by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford
  to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.
</p>
<p>
  By submitting your information via this website, you are authorizing www.fastloan.site and its partners to do a credit check,
  which may include verifying your social security number, driver license number or other identification, and a review of
  your creditworthiness. Credit checks are usually performed by one of the major credit bureaus such as Experian, Equifax
  and TransUnion, but also may include alternative credit bureaus such as Teletrack, DP Bureau or others. You also authorize
  www.fastloan.site to share your information and credit history with a network of approved lenders and lending partners.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Lender’s Disclosure of Terms.</strong>
</p>
<p>The lender you are connected to will provide documents that contain all fees and rate information pertaining to the loan
  being offered, including any potential fees for late-payments and the rules under which you may be allowed (if permitted
  by applicable law) to refinance, renew or rollover your loan. Loan fees and interest rates are determined solely by the
  lender based on the lender’s internal policies, underwriting criteria and applicable law. www.fastloan.site has no knowledge
  of or control over the loan terms offered by a lender. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered
  by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay
  or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Late Payments Hurt Your Credit Score</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Please be aware that missing a payment or making a late payment can negatively impact your credit score. To protect yourself
  and your credit history, make sure you only accept loan terms that you can afford to repay. If you cannot make a payment
  on time, you should contact your lender immediately and discuss how to handle late payments.
