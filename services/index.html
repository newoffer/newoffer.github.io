<p>Instructions for Water Heater Expansion Tank Installation:<br>
The expansion tank is usually installed directly above the water heater using a 
tee installed in the cold water inlet. The expansion tank is usually installed 
horizontally, although it can be installed vertically if required due to limited 
space. The plumbing fittings you'll need depend on the type of plumbing you have 
and the orientation of the expansion tank, but the most common connections are 
made with copper pipes and fittings. The expansion tank itself usually has a 
3/4&quot; threaded fitting that connects to the cold water pipe with a tee and short 
lengths or threaded or soldered pipes.<br>
<br>
Attach dielectric coupling<br>
Once the water heater is properly positioned, attach the dielectric sleeve to 
the cold water inlet. Wrap the threads of the fitting with sealing tape, then 
screw it into the cold water inlet on the water heater using a pipe wrench or 
pliers.<br>
<br>
Connect the copper adapter<br>
Wrap a few loops of pipe sealing tape around the top threads of the connection, 
then thread the female copper adapter onto the union. Tighten securely with a 
pipe wrench or pliers.<br>
<br>
Attach tee<br>
Install the short copper pipe and tee to the adapter on the dielectric fitting 
of the water heater. Typically, the tee should be about 30 cm above the water 
heater to provide enough clearance for the expansion tank. Most plumbers make 
these connections by soldering afterwards, but they can also be made with 
push-in connections (sometimes called &quot;shark bite&quot;).<br>
<br>
Attach the expansion tank pipe<br>
Attach a short length of horizontal copper pipe to the side outlet of the tee 
using soldering or push-fit connections. The length of this copper pipe will 
depend on the space available, but it's best to keep it as short as possible - 
no more than 6 inches or so. At the end of the horizontal pipe, attach the 
female adapter using soldering or a tight joint.<br>
<br>
Attach expansion tank<br>
Wrap the pipe sealing tape around the expansion tank threaded fitting, then 
screw it onto the threaded adapter on the horizontal pipe. Usually 
hand-tightening is sufficient; be careful not to overtighten or damage pipes or 
fittings.<br>
<br>
Complete the installation<br>
Complete the installation by connecting the top outlet of the tee to the cold 
water supply using all necessary pipes and fittings. Many plumbers make this 
connection with copper flexible tubing rather than rigid tubing.<br>
<br>
Also complete the connection of the hot water piping to the water heater, then 
turn on the water heater, open the water taps and check the operation by looking 
for leaks.
